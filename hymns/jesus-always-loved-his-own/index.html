  <p>Jesus always loved His own <br />
And He showed it to the full; <br />
When at supper from the table, <br />
He got up and took a towel. <br />
Then He wrapped it round His waist, <br />
In a basin water poured, <br />
And began to wash the feet of all His friends.</p>

<p><strong>Know my people, what I’ve done to you: <br />
Lord, you call me - it is what I am. <br />
If then I, your Lord, designed to wash your feet, <br />
You should do the same and wash each other’s feet.</strong></p>

<p>Jesus always loved His own <br />
And He showed it to the full; <br />
When He came to Simon Peter, <br />
The apostle said to Him, <br />
“Never shall You wash my feet,” <br />
Then the Lord replied to him: <br />
“It is not for you to know what now I do.”</p>

<p>Jesus always loved His own <br />
And He showed it to the full; <br />
When He said to Simon Peter; <br />
“If I do not wash your feet, <br />
You can have no part with me,” <br />
Then said Peter to his Lord, <br />
“Wash my hands, my head and not my feet alone.”</p>

<p>Jesus always loved His own <br />
And He showed it to the full; <br />
He has set us an example, <br />
That we do as He has done. <br />
Can a servant greater be, <br />
Than his master, Christ the Lord? <br />
If we know and do this, happy we shall be.</p>
