title: "Hail Holy Queen Enthroned Above"
---

1. Hail, Holy Queen enthroned above, O Maria.   
Hail, Mother of mercy and of love, O Maria.

**Triumph all ye Cherubim   
Sing with us sweet Seraphim   
Heaven and earth resound our hymn   
Salve, Salve, Salve Regina.**

2. Our life our sweetness here below, O Maria.   
Out hope in sorrow and in woe, O Maria.

1. To thee we cry, poor sons of Eve, O Maria.   
To thee we sigh, we morn, we grieve, O Maria.

1. When this our exile is complete, O Maria.   
Show us thy Son, our Jesus sweet, O Maria.

1. O clement, gracious, Mary sweet, O Maria.   
O Virgin Mary, we entreat, O Maria.
